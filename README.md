# 📘 JavaScript Documentation Page

A clean and structured **JavaScript Documentation Page** built using **HTML5** and **CSS3**, as part of the **Responsive Web Design Certification** from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org).  
This project simulates a technical documentation page and helps reinforce semantic structure and responsive layout techniques.
> **Note:** The web page is intentionally left incomplete, and many JavaScript topics are missing. This was done solely to fulfill the requirements of the exercise.
